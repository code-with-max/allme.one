https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25319690/how-do-i-run-a-flask-app-in-gunicorn-if-i-used-the-application-factory-pattern



Create a file wsgi.py under your project with the following contents, then point Gunicorn at it.

from app import create_app
app = create_app()

gunicorn -w 4 wsgi:app
# -w 4 specifies four worker processes

If you're using the application factory pattern, Gunicorn allows specifying a function call like my_project:create_app(). For most cases, you can the skip making a wsgi.py file and tell Gunicorn how to create your app directly.

gunicorn -w 4 "app:create_app()"

Note that the quotes are necessary in some shells where parentheses have special meaning.
